## Create a VM image

While QEMU itself is compatible with almost any guest OS that runs on x86 hardware architecture, DECAF requires more knowledge about the OS to bridge the semantic gap and provide information about OS abstractions like processes. DECAF currently supports Windows XP, Windows 7 and Linux, in order to use our tool, user has to have a working qemu image of the operating system. As how to make a qemu image,please see [QCOW2 image Format](http://people.gnome.org/~markmc/qcow-image-format.html).

It's very slow to install an image using QEMU because it's a whole-system virtual simulator. You can try VirtualBox to create a QCOW format virtual disk and install OS image. QEMU/DECAF can directly load that QCOW image without any modifications.

- If you have a vmdk format image(used by vmware), you can convert it into qcow2 format by `qemu-img conver /path/to/vmdk_image -O qcow win2kpro.img`.
- If you have a vid format image(used by VirtualBox), you can conver it into qcow2 format by `VBoxManage clonehd --format RAW path/to/vdi_image img.raw && qemu-img convert -f raw raw.img -O Qcow2 image.qcow`
- With the new VMI support, guest driver is no longer needed by DECAF.image created from VMware/VirtualBox drivers uninstalled before converted to QEMU image. If the VMI doesn't work, please see [discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/decaf-platform-discuss/SK6-HdMf6Dg).

## VMI configuration for Linux

The configuration is for guest system using Linux only. There is no extra configuration for Windows. 

1. **Compile and insert kernel module**

   * Copy *procinfo.c* and Makefile under `/path/to/decaf/shared/kernelinfo/procinfo_generic/` into some directory in the guest OS.

   * In guest OS, change directory to `/path/to/procinfo.c_and_Makefile`, type `make` 
   * Install the kernel mod into current system.`sudo ins mod ./procinfo.ko`. Attention, it's ok if you see "Operation not permitted" since this module only print some message.
   * Check whether the kernel works well using `dmesg`.

2. **Update *procinfo.ini*  **

   You you will see something like this after running `dmesg`.

```verilog
[20451.579763] strName = 3.2.0-37-generic
[20451.579764] init_task_addr = 3246178336
[20451.579765] init_task_size = 3236 
...
[20451.579787] ti_task = 0
```

â€‹	Remove the leading time and brackets. Copy the rest content into `/path/to/decaf/shared/kernelinfo/procinfo_generic/procinfo.ini`. Add a new section. Increment `info.total` at the beginning of procinfo.ini to help the compiler handle it. Following is an example of it.

```ini
[info]
total = 7
...

[7]
strName. = 3.2.0-37-generic
init_task_addr = 3246178336
init_task_size = 3236
...
ti_task = 0
```

### Possible Errors

* UTS_RELEASE is not defined or utsrelease.h cannot be found. Define UTS_RELEASE as a unique string by yourself.

### Configuration for shared library (optional)

To hook library functions, you need to configure the offsets. For each guest OS, there. is a librara configuration file for it in `/path/to/decaf/shared/kernelinfo/procinfo_generic/lib_conf/`. The file name of the configuration file is `[strName].ini`. In a library configuration file, there is a section for each shared library file. In each section , there is a `decaf_conf_libpath` field for the shared library file name. `decaf_conf_libpath` is the file name, don't include any path.

```ini
decaf_conf_libpath = libc-2.13.so
# do not use decaf_conf_libpath = /usr/lib/libc-2.13.so
```

For each function, there is also a field. The field name is the name of the function. The field value is the offset. The field name and value can be obtainted using the following command in guest OS, You may need to adjust the command according to your environment.

```shell
 objdump -T /path/to/shared/library/in/guest/OS | awk '/\.text/ && $6 !~ /\(.*\)/ {printf("%-30s= %d\n",$7,"0x"$1)}'
```



## Startup the Virtual Machine

Now you have get everything ready, the next step is to start the emulator and run the virtual machine.

1. Go to DECAF/trunk/i386-softmmu
2. Run the following command

```shell
./qemu-system-i386 -monitor stdio -m 512 -netdev user,id=mynet -device rtl8139,netdev=mynet /path/to/your/image
```

3. If you want to use snapshot function, you can add snapshot option.

## Complie and load plugins

DECAF provides many interfaces to trace internal events of the guest operating system. You can write your analysis plugins using these interfaces. To learn how to write plugins, plugin samples is the best place to start with. Download plugin samples. Take callbacktests plugin as an example.

1.  Compile plugins

```shell
cd ./callbacktests

# set decaf location
./configure --decaf-path=/path/to/decaf

make
```

2. Load plugins

```shell
# start virtual machine, cd to /path/to/decaf/trunk/i386-softmmu
./qemu-system-i386 -monitor stdio -m 512 -netdev user,id=mynet -device rtl8139,netdev=mynet /path/to/your/image
# Then you will get the shell of decaf/qemu.
# check available cmds
(qemu) help

# load plugins
(qemu) load_plugin /path/to/decaf/callbacktest/callbacktests.so
```

3. Trace program

```shell
# trace a specific program

do_callbacktests calc.exe

# now you can start calc.exe in the guest operating system to see the results.
```

## Troubleshooting

This section describes some problems users have experienced when using DECAF, along with the most common causes of these problems. If you have any other questions, please post them on **Forum**.

* After start Decaf, the terminal says "vnc server running on 127.0.0.1 7 5900" and. There. is no running guest os shown up.
  * This is because SDL library is not properly installed. You just need to reinstall SDL.
* When compile plugin, it can not find lcrypto.
  * You need to make a link to lcrypto.xxx.so to lcrypto.so. If you can not find lcrypto.xxx.so library, just install ssh to get it.
